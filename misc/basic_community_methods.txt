Modularity-based clustering:

Modularity is the fraction of the edges that fall within the given groups minus the expected fraction if edges were distributed at random.

Centrality-based clustering:

Has cluster heads and member nodes. Considers optimal member node degree for a cluster and distance to cluster heads from member nodes.

Clique percolation-based clustering:

Built from k-cliques (where every two vertices in a clique have distinct edges). Two k-cliques are connected if they share k-1 nodes.

Hierarchical-based clustering:

Either agglomerative or divisive and created using a greedy algorithm.

Spectral-based clustering:

Makes use of the spectrum of the similarity matrix of the data to perform dimensionality reduction.
